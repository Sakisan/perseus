Harp.js Boilerplate
====================
My starter Harp.js app. Get prototyping in minutes, or use it to learn by example! This will set you up with a partial, a layout, global variables, and a bunch of other useful features such as stylus mixins, icons, and more!

Usage
-----

* install [Node](http://nodejs.org/download/) `brew install node`
* install Harp.js `npm install -g harp`
* clone the repo
* `cd` into the newly created `harpjs-boilerplate` folder
* start the server with `harp server`
* get coding!

For documentation, usage, and more information about Harp.js check out [their homepage](http://harpjs.com/).
